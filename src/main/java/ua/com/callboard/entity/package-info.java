 * This package contains the entities that are inherited from AbstractEntity 
 * with an annotation @MappedSuperclass.
 * 
 * Typically, an entity represents a table in a relational database, 
 * and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table.
 * 
 * The persistent state of an entity is represented through 
 * either persistent fields vs persistent properties.
 * 
 * All classes was annotated with the javax.persistence.Entity annotation.
